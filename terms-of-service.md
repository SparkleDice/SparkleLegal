## 4. User Content

Our Bot may allow you to provide, submit, or generate content, such as character information, inventory item details, game tracking data, custom signatures, or other data necessary for bot features ("User Content").

You retain ownership of your User Content. However, by providing User Content to the Bot, you grant us a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to store, process, display, and use your User Content solely as necessary to provide and maintain the Bot's functionality and services to you.

You are solely responsible for your User Content and the consequences of providing or sharing it through our Bot. You represent and warrant that:
* You own or have the necessary rights and permissions to use and authorize us to use your User Content as described in these Terms.
* Your User Content does not violate the privacy rights, publicity rights, copyright, contractual rights, or any other rights of any person or entity, nor does it violate any applicable laws.

We reserve the right, but are not obligated, to review and remove any User Content that violates these Terms or that we find objectionable in our sole discretion, without prior notice.

## 5. Intellectual Property

Excluding User Content, the Bot itself, including its name ("Sparkle"), source code, features, functionality, graphics, and logos, are and will remain the exclusive intellectual property of the Bot owner(s)/developer(s). These Terms do not grant you any rights to use the Sparkle name or trademarks without our prior written permission.

## 6. Disclaimer of Warranties

THE BOT IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" BASIS. USE OF THE BOT IS AT YOUR OWN RISK.
